		"You can use an action to play this cornett in the typical manner. The cornett emits sound in a 30-foot cone that is audible 30 feet away. Each creature in the cone must make a DC 14 Constitution saving throw or be {@condition stunned} until the end of your next turn. Creatures who succeed on their saving throw have their speed reduced by 10, to a minimum of 0.",
		"Once you use the cornett in this way, it cannot be used again until the next dawn."
