Fauns are always males but can and do breed with anything. In that regard they often prey on dryads and nymphs, but are also known to carry off brides and other women at weddings. The male offspring are always fauns. Fauns are believed to be originating from the curse of an archfey, cast onto a satyr as punishment for seducing its true love: \"May you look as beastly outside as you are inside, and may all that you sire suffer the same fate.\""

They break the will of the prisoners, draining them avidly of their soul and inflicting excruciating torment until nothing is left but a servile, broken, captive. Tormentors use their insidious powers to fashion partially real substitute of a creature, formed from ice or snow, and infused with a fragment of the creature's soul. These fetches, as they are called, take the place of a creature, living its life as the creature would have until its master requires its service. Fetches are often released after raids, pretending to be returning survivors, spreading fear and misinformation on the Wild Hunt. In other cases, when the disappearance of a person would cause too much of a commotion, or when the tormentor would gain to have a pawn in a strategic location, a person is kidnaped purposely to be replaced by a fetch."

						"Among the most influential figures in the isles are the leathdhia, the supposed descendants of the legendary Tuatha Dé, the tribe of the gods. These men and women carry an ancestral and potent bloodline, sacred in the eyes of all Waelen. This status of living demigod places them outside and above the usual hierarchy of power, allowing them to come and go as they please, much like the völur of the Northlanders. Guided by the will of the goddess alone, the leathdhia are revered by the druids as conduits of the goddess, and play a central part in local worship, acting as high priest. However, just as the goddess herself, leathdhia are mercurial, for the threefold divine aspects drive them.",
						"The internal strife of the leathdhia leaves very few of them unscathed and, truth be told, many are considered to be dangerous lunatics. Only a handful are willed enough to maintain their own personality and find balance with the goddess. Those that do are the bridge between mortal and the divine and are constantly sought after. As a result, some live the life of a hermit, weeding out supplicants with trials and deception. Others wander the isles, hiding their identity by posing as minstrels or beggars.",
						"Thanks to their legacy, the leathdhia share a fragment of divine essence, pushing them to the pinnacle of mortal abilities and beyond. Most are immortal and are believed to be hundreds of years old. They are also nearly impervious to harm, be it from blade or spell. Though not invincible, they are extremely hard to kill, getting back up after receiving mortal blows. The birth of a leathdhia is foretold by the moon spirits of the Earthmother, its life sung by the thunder of Badb and its death screamed by Da Dhiogail's red furies. To truly kill a leathdhia its life must be severed of the three aspects of the goddess, by a threefold death. The threefold death carries great significance and symbolism for the Waelen. Sacrifices offered to the Earthmother and her other aspects follow this custom, putting to death the sacrifice from three distinct sources simultaneously. Often used are poison, blade and drowning, but many variations exist from clan to clan, ranging from wicker man pyre to simple strangulation.",

Those that delve deep into eldritch lore will eventually learn of the vozhark rites. It is known under many other names and variations, such as the Baneful Eclipse of Stillborn Atropus, The Forlorn Key of All-Seeing Bolothamogg, the Dismal Awakening of Great Cthulhu, or the Thousand Crimson Rebirth of Piscaethces. These ascension rituals are the lifegoals of the most ambitious cult leaders. But it takes an exceptional individual, quite mad and corrupted, to accept and survive the otherworldly gift, a warlock of immense power whose body has mutated over decades to finally cast the ritual and receive the alien blessing of the vozhark. A vozhark is the chosen herald, or talking puppet, of an Elder Evil in the Material Plane, a prime vessel for the eldritch might of its master. To face a vozhark is to stare at that which lurks beyond the stars, a glimpse at the true power of the cosmic horror peering through the flesh.",
						"Although the outer gods share the ritual's knowledge quite willingly, to perform it successfully is a very different story. Its components are rare and precious, taking great resources and dedication to acquire. Once this by no means trivial matter has been taken care of, the ritual requires a favorable planetary alignment and the capricious stars do so every so often. It can take a few decades or centuries before it can be attempted in optimal conditions. Even then, there is a good chance that the mind and body of the aspiring vozhark will collapse under the arrival of the ancient being, requiring years of preparations from the warlock to survive the ordeal. Lastly, there is an even greater chance that the Elder Evil will simply be offended by the contact attempt and annihilate all participants here and now. Needless to say, the actual emergence of a vozhark is a rare thing to behold.",

A purer form of lead, called deep lead or sometimes dimeritium, exists. It is a silvery metal with a hint of blue found only rarely in mineral veins. Deep lead is highly toxic, and those frequently exposed to it regularly experience migraines, respiratory diseases or even seizures. These effects are amplified for magical creatures and spellcasters that will instantly feel nauseous in its presence and intense physical pain at its contact. Witch Hunters rely heavily on deep lead and have integrated in their arsenal several devices based on that metal to face their most dangerous enemy: spellcasters."

For this reason, most are constantly chained and never see the light of the day, locked down in some deep vault until there is no other solution left but to use them.
